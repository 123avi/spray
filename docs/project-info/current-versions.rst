Current Versions
================

Since *spray* heavily depends on Akka_ its releases are usually closely tied to specific Akka versions.


0.9.0
-----

This version targets Scala 2.9.x and Akka 1.3.x and is therefore not recommended for new projects anymore.
Its documentation doesn't live here but in the (old) `github wiki`_.


1.0.1 / 1.1.1 / 1.2.1 / 1.3.1
-----------------------------

The current and stable *spray* release is a quadrupel release,
targeting Scala 2.9 and Scala 2.10 as well as four Akka versions at the same time.

Please choose |1.0|, |1.1|, |1.2| or |1.3| depending on what Scala/Akka version you are targeting:

Nightly Builds
--------------

If you'd like to have access to the most recent changes and additions without having to build *spray* yourself you can
rely on the nightly builds, which we are currently publishing for the `release/1.0`_, `release/1.1`_, `release/1.2`_ and
`release/1.3`_ branches of the *spray* repository. Every day shortly past midnight UTC a new build is made available
unless the respective branch has not seen any new commits since the last build.

In order to help you identify the exact commit from which a build is cut every artifact directory includes a
``commit-<version>.html`` file containing the commit hash with a link to the commit on github.

Nightly builds are available from the http://nightlies.spray.io repository.
